Mon. January 18th: This is the first day of the new project in which I'll be building a market analysis app to figure out which products are most likely to sell in the buss mall catalog.  I will be displaying three products at a time on a user facing page and will be asking for the user to vote on the most appealing product.  Using JavaScript I will calculate and store these results as well as display more products to the user.  After running through 15 different products the user will be able to see the results of the analysis.  In my user stories.md file I will have all of the user stories I have written in order to keep track of my project goals.  

End of Monday: I created a user facing page displaying three images.  My JavaScript page generates a random number based on the length of my array holding all of my image objects.  Using an event listener to be triggered by a "click" I have three random images generated.  


Tuesday. January19th: After my second day I have successfully installed a chart that updates bases on my product analysis.  I have installed a button that hides results after a chosen amount of products are inspected.

Wednesday. January20th. Finished creating a new chart for percentages as well as updating some more CSS.  I tried to lint this project but couldn't get my linter to run the linting commands

Thursday Morning. January21st.  Got linting to work and D.R.Y'd out my code.

Friday January 22nd.  Final push of my final project "Buss Mall".  My project is finished and fully linted.  I have local storage working and both charts producing accurate numbers.  It was a great experience making this project.
